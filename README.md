# Judopay Additions

This project is a web UI that will help you set up a card payment form on your website. Any fields holding sensitive information (Card Number, CVC and Expiry Date) are hosted and processed by Judo in an iframe, helping you to achieve PCI compliance.

Judopay Additions allows you to fully modify the styles of the fields to match your website, and all language translations are supported.

Or check out our [translation sample](https://additions.judopay.com/Checkout/Index) where you can see Additions being rendered and dynamically switch the form between 5 languages.
